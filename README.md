# video-adblock
Fork of Adblock for Youtube without their popups.


 - Fork of [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-for-youtube/cmedhionkhpnakcndndgjdbohmhepckk?hl=en) but without all the bullshit, no popups, no asking to rate the extension.
 - You should still uncheck the "Share and Support Developers..." button to prevent tracking.
 - I made this because this is the only adblocker for YouTube that consistently works, but it's got its own evils, which this fork aims to remove.
